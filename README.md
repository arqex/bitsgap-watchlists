# Install

I'm trying to get this extension available through the Chrome Extension Store, but until it gets accepted, you can download the zip file fron the "Code" green button here at github.

Once you have downloaded, you can unzip the folder in your computer, and follow the instructions of this tutorial: https://webkul.com/blog/how-to-install-the-unpacked-extension-in-chrome/

The steps in the tutorial are:
* Go to the Chrome menu -> More tools -> Extensions
* At the top right of the Extensions screen, you need to enable the developer mode toggle.
* Then a button bar will appear at the top of the screen, with the option "Load unpacked", click it.
* Select the folder you have just uncompressed with the code of the plugin.
* Enable the plugin.
* Go to the Bitsgap site to see it working.
